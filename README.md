# BECK-SVG-Logos

# Overview & User Story

The goal of this project was to create a simple, command-line application for freelance web developers who want to create logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. With this product, the user can quickly generate customizable logos with a few text and shape options.

# How this product works and meets the acceptance criteria 

The user is prompted to put in specific information that is detailed as follows -
Text: limited to three characters (SVG for example).
Text Color: keyword or hexadecimal number (Charcoal or #333333).
Shape: choose from circle, triangle, or square.
Shape Color: keyword or hexadecimal number

Based on the user input, the logo will create an SVG file named "logo.svg" with their specified text, shape, and colors centered within the shape. Once the user is finished entering all of the prompted information, a display message in the CLI appears at the bottom of the prompt saying "Generated logo.svg".

Then the logo will appear in the root of the directory, where the 300x200 logo can be opened in the users default browser.
